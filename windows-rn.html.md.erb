## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in <%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.7

<%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.7 includes the following major features:

### <a id='azure-stack'></a> Enable <%= vars.product_windows_full %> Windows Stemcell Image Deployment on Azure Stack

In <%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.7, Windows stemcell images published in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace can be  
syndicated into the Microsoft Azure Stack (MAS) marketplace.

### <a id='windows2016'></a> Removal of the windows2016 Stack

In <%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.7, the `windows2016` stack is removed. Before you upgrade to <%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.7, you must migrate any apps that run on the `windows2016` stack to the `windows` stack.

You can migrate your apps from `windows2016` to `windows` using Stack Auditor, a Cloud Foundry CLI plugin.
For more information, see [Using the Stack Auditor Plugin](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/adminguide/stack-auditor.html).

### <a id='vcr-libs'></a> Pre-Installed Visual C++ Redistributables

<%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.7 includes pre-installed Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables for Visual Studio 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019. This change is backported to <%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.2.

This update improves the developer experience by making VisualC++ Redistributables readily available for .NET apps. Developers no longer have to manually bin deploy to reference C++ or C++ based libraries.

### <a id='agent-based-syslog-egress'></a> Agent-Based Syslog Egress Is Enabled by Default

<%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.7 contains Syslog Agent, an agent that forwards logs to configured syslog drains and Loggregator. Syslog Agent is enabled by default, and the option to enable or disable syslog egress is removed from the PAS UI.

Additionally, the instance groups `syslog_adapter` and `syslog_scheduler`,
and the property `syslog_metrics_to_syslog_enabled`
are removed, as agent-based syslog egress removes the need for VMs dedicated to syslog drains.

For more information about how Syslog Agent functions within Loggregator, see [Loggregator Architecture](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/loggregator/architecture.html) and the [loggregator-agent-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-agent-release) repository on GitHub.

### <a id='rdp'></a> RDP Support Removed in Favor of BOSH SSH

<p class="note warning"><b>Warning:</b> This feature is a breaking change. See <a href="./breaking-changes.html#rdp">RDP is Not Supported</a> in <i><%= vars.product_name %> v2.7 Breaking Changes</i>.</p>

The **Enable Remote Desktop Protocol** field is removed from the PASW tile. PASW VMs do not support connection through RDP.

This is part of a larger effort to achieve platform parity with Linux VMs by enabling `bosh ssh` for all actions related to the Windows VMs.

To access Windows VMs, use `bosh ssh`. To enable `bosh ssh` for Windows VM, select **Enable BOSH-native SSH support on all VMs** in the PASW tile.

For more information, see the [Configure VMs](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service-windows/2-7/installing.html#config-vms) section in _Installing and Configuring PASW_.


### <a id='windows-stemcells-microsoft-baseline'></a> Windows Server 2019 VM Stemcells Follow Microsoft Baseline Security Standard

Stemcell hardening for Windows Server 2019 stemcells on both <%= vars.product_full %> and Pivotal Container Service (PKS) is updated to more closely follow the Microsoft Baseline Security Standard. This improves the security for Windows stemcells and better aligns the stemcell hardening practices with an industry standard.

This is part of a larger effort to align Windows stemcells with the Microsoft Baseline Security Standard.

<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Windows stemcells do not yet align completely with the Microsoft Baseline Security Standard. For details on the ways in which Windows stemcell hardening differs from the Microsoft Baseline Security Standard, contact Pivotal at <a href="mailto:myemail@example.com">pcf-windows@pivotal.io</a>.</p>

For more information about how Windows Server 2019 stemcells align with the Microsoft Baseline Security Standard, see [Windows Stemcell Hardening](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-7/security/pcf-infrastructure/windows-stemcell-hardening.html).


## <a id='adv-features'></a> New Advanced Features

The **Advanced Features** pane of the <%= vars.product_windows_full %> tile includes new functionality that may have certain constraints.

Although these features are fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in production.

<%= vars.product_windows_full %> v2.7 includes the following advanced features:

### <a id='beta-tls'></a> (Beta) Enable TLS Connections From Router to Apps

You can enable TLS connections from the router to apps. This feature is available in the <%= vars.product_windows_full %> tile under **Advanced Features**.

You can select three different options to add route integrity and mTLS (mutual TLS):

* **Disable route integrity and mutual TLS (Default)**: This beta feature is disabled by default.
* **Router uses TLS to verify application identity**: This enables route integrity for your apps but not mTLS.
* **Router and applications use mutual TLS to verify each other's identity (incompatible with TCP Routing)**: This option enables both route integrity and mTLS.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This beta feature checks only that the client certificate is signed by the expected CA using mTLS. It does not include Subject Alternative Name (SAN) checks of the presented client certificates.</p>
