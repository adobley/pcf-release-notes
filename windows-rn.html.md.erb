## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features in PAS for Windows v2.6

PAS for Windows v2.6.0 includes the following major features:

### <a id='graceful-shutdown'></a> App Developers Can Gracefully Shutdown Their .NET Applications in PASW

PAS for Windows v2.6.0 allows a PCF app 10 seconds to gracefully shutdown after it is stopped using `cf stop`. 
Graceful shutdown is supported on deployments running Windows Server 2019 or later. For additional information see 
[Graceful Shutdown](https://dotnet-cookbook.cfapps.io/aspnet/graceful-shutdown/) in the .NET Cookbook.

### <a id='system-metrics-agent'></a> Introduction of System Metrics Agent

PAS for Windows v2.6 includes the introduction of the System Metrics Agent. When the System Metrics Agent is enabled, 
Windows cells emit system-level metrics about each VM in your deployment. You can enable this feature in the PAS for 
Windows v2.6 tile by selecting **Enable System Metrics** within the **System Logging** pane.


### <a id='windows2016'></a> Deprecation of the windows2016 Stack

PAS for Windows v2.6 removes support for `windows2016` in favor of the `windows` stack.
You must migrate any apps that run on the `windows2016` stack to the `windows` stack.

You can migrate your apps from `windows2016` to `windows` using Stack Auditor, a Cloud Foundry CLI plugin.
For more information, see [Using the Stack Auditor Plugin](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/stack-auditor.html).

### <a id='odbc'></a>ODBC Driver Installation Support in Windows Containers

PAS for Windows v2.6 supports ODBC driver installation by giving  developers the ability to add ODBC driver 
entries to the Windows Registry. Previously, ODBC drivers were installed to Windows cells using BOSH add-ons. 
Installing ODBC drivers by using BOSH add-ons is no longer possible in true Windows containerized runtimes.

### <a id='bosh-ssh'></a> BOSH SSH Enabled by Default

In PAS for Windows v2.6, use of the `bosh ssh` command is enabled by default for deployed VMs. 
Developers can use the `bosh ssh` command to troubleshoot Windows-based Diego cells.

### <a id='gcs'></a> Deploy Windows Stemcells on BOSH Director with GCS

PAS for Windows v2.6 supports deploying Windows stemcells with a BOSH Director that uses GCS as the BOSH blobstore. 

For more information on configuring a GCS blobstore, see _Director Config Page_ in 
[Configuring BOSH Director on GCP Manually](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/2-6/gcp/config-manual.html#director-config) 
or _Director Config Page_ in [Configuring BOSH Director on GCP Using Terraform](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/2-6/gcp/config-terraform.html).

### <a id='improve-scalabillity'></a> Improved Application Syslog Drain Scalability

PAS for Windows v2.6.0 has improved application syslog drain scalability. 
With v2.6 a new syslog agent architecture has been implemented. 

## <a id='adv-features'></a> New Advanced Features

The **Advanced Features** pane of the PAS for Windows tile includes new functionality that may have
certain constraints.

Although these features are fully supported, Pivotal recommends caution when using them in
production.

PAS for Windows v2.6 includes the following advanced features:

## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

This section includes known issues with PAS for Windows v2.6.

### <a id='syslog'></a> App Syslog Drains Fail After Enabling Agent-Based Syslog

If you select **Enable agent-based syslog egress for app logs** in the **System Logging** pane of the PAS tile, 
external syslog drains that are bound to Windows Apps cannot collect logs. For more information, see 
["Enable agent-based syslog egress for app logs" interrupts external log collection for PAS Windows apps](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/enable-agent-based-syslog-egress-for-app-logs).
