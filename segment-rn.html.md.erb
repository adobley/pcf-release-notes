## <a id='intro'></a> About PCF Isolation Segment

The PCF Isolation Segment v2.8 tile is available for installation with PCF v2.8.

[Isolation segments](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-8/concepts/security.html#isolation-segments) provide dedicated pools of resources where you can deploy apps and isolate workloads. Using isolation segments separates app resources as completely as if they were in different CF deployments but avoids redundant management and network complexity.

For more information about using isolation segments in your deployment, see the [Managing Isolation Segments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-8/adminguide/isolation-segments.html) topic.
