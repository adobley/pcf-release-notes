### <a id="beta-1"></a> 2.6 Beta 1

* **[Breaking Change]**: The `stemcells_assignments` endpoint has been renamed `stemcell_associations`.
* **[New Feature]**: An error appears when you use `PATCH /api/v0/stemcell_assignments` to assign stemcells to any product that requires multiple stemcells.
* **[New Feature]**: Operators can back up the Director S3 blobstore for versioned and un-versioned buckets. To configure backup, select an S3 external blobstore for the Director and choose your preference for backup with the **Backup Strategy** radio button.
* **[New Feature]**: The Review Pending Changes page shows stemcells that you have added to a deployment in the "Changes" column.
* **[New Feature]**: The Review Pending Changes page shows information for multiple stemcells, where applicable.
* **[New Feature]**: The Stemcell Library UI has been enhanced.
* **[New Feature]**: The Change Log table UI has been enhanced.
* **[New Feature]**: Ops Manager's template syslog form is available for service broker tiles. When tile developers use the `opsmanager_syslog` key in tile metadata, an option to upload a new runtime config appears after an operator triggers **Apply Changes**. The service broker and any service instances created afterward will have a `syslog_forwarder` job to allow them to use Ops Manager's syslog.
* **[New Feature]**: vSphere operators are no longer required to specify a `port` key for NSX load balancers. Setting the port number as `null` allows the TCP router to rely on default ports specified by other system components.
* **[New Feature]**: `ops-manifest` now supports `$runtime` expressions in addition to `$self`, `$director`, and `$ops_manager`.
* **[New Feature]**: Tile authors can specify a new job-level key called `use_stemcell`, the value of which is the full name of the operating system. This allows authors to specify which stemcell they wish to use for a given job.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Operators can no longer assign a stemcell with the incorrect infrastructure type on the Stemcell Library page.
* **[Bug Fix]**: When you delete an unused product, all the stemcells associated with it are also deleted.
* **[Bug Fix]**: **Apply Changes** no longer fails if copying credentials to CredHub takes longer than ten minutes.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Ops Manager saves the start time for the `InstallationChange` object for runtime config-only tiles.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Exporting installation settings no longer causes the BOSH Director to incorrectly show that it has staged changes.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Harbour now installs successfully on deployments that already have PKS installed.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Operators can no longer change persistent disk size to custom values.
* **[Bug Fix]**: All product stemcells display a notification when it is out of date, even when there are multiple stemcells associated with a product.

### <a id="alpha-2"></a> 2.6 Alpha 2

* **[Breaking Change]**: API users can use `GET /api/v0/diagnostic_report` to show stemcells for all staged and deployed products. The `stemcells` key replaces the `stemcell` key. `Stemcells` lists information for all stemcells assigned to a product.
* **[Breaking Change]**: API users can use `GET /api/v0/staged/pending_changes` to see the staged, deployed, and last successfully deployed stemcell information for all stemcells associated with a product. Multiple keys in this endpoint have changed. The `stemcell` key has changed to `stemcells` and the output of the endpoint has been reformatted to display details, including the OS and version keys, more specifically for deployments with multiple stemcells.
* **[New Feature]**: Operators using AWS-based deployments can choose between even more AWS regions in the AWS Config form. Deployments upgraded from v2.5 will default to the AWS region you chose for that deployment.
* **[New Feature]**: After a deployment fails, API users can use `POST /api/v0/installations` to see which products are not fully configured.
* **[New Feature]**: The Stemcell Library page now supports uploading and assigning multiple stemcells.
* **[New Feature]**: API users can assign one or multiple stemcells to a product using the multi-stemcell API, `PATCH /api/v0/stemcells_assignments`. `GET /api/v0/stemcells_assignments` returns information on all the stemcells assigned to products.
* **[New Feature]**: The Change Log page has an improved UI, including a new column specifying build duration and a new footer row summarizing the installation details.
* **[New Feature]**: API users can use `GET /api/v0/staged/director/pre_deploy_check` to see details about the Director's configuration before deployment.
* **[New Feature]**: After a deployment fails, API users can use `/api/v0/staged/products/:PRODUCT-GUID/pre_deploy_check` to see which form verifiers in a product are causing the failure.
* **[New Feature]**: Tile authors can use a form and install time verifier to verify vSphere IaaS properties.
* **[New Feature]**: Tile authors can upload tiles that support multiple stemcells. Use the `additional_stemcells_criteria` key to specify an array of additional stemcells for operators to use. Choose a stemcell with the `stemcell_selector` property key included in `PUT /api/v0/staged/products/:PRODUCT-GUID/properties`.
* **[New Feature]**: Tile authors can create and deploy their own manifests using non-default stemcells. Use a `stemcells` block in the manifest to specify an alias, OS, and version for a stemcell. Additionally, you can use the following double-parens accessors to see further details about stemcells: `(( my_stemcell_selector.os ))`, `(( my_stemcell_selector.version ))`, `(( my_stemcell_selector.assigned? ))`, `(( my_stemcell_selector.value ))`, (( my_stemcell_selector.value_present? ))`.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Ops Manager operators can no longer upload a duplicate stemcell to the Stemcell Library.
* **[Bug Fix]**: Ops Manager operators on vSphere-based deployments can now use spaces in the folder names for their vCenter config information.

### <a id="alpha-1"></a> 2.6 Alpha 1

* **[Breaking Change]**: (vSphere only) You can no longer ssh into a VM on a vSphere Ops Manager without a private key.
* **[New Feature]**: `GET /api/v0/installations` now displays the start and end time for a deployment of each product. Products that are upgraded from earlier versions of Ops Manager will display `null` for their start and end times.
* **[New Feature]**: Ops Manager operators cannot set secrets that do not match the constraints defined by the must_match_regex parameter.
* **[New Feature]**: Ops Manager supports 5th generation AWS Instance Types. 5th generation Instance Types are the default when a v2.6 Ops Manager boots.
* **[New Feature]**: You can now specify a monitor port when defining a NSX load balancer. Send a PUT to `/api/v0/staged/products/:guid/properties/jobs/:job_id/resource_config` with a  `monitor_port` key. This features helps to support NSX load balancer compatibility with Gorouter, which requires a monitor port of `8080` and a traffic port of `80`.
* **[UI Improvement]**: The banner notifying you that certificates in your deployment will expire in the next three months is edited for improved clarity and usefulness.

## <a id='major-features'></a> New Features in Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %>

Ops Manager <%= vars.v_major_version %> includes the following major features:

### <a id="folder-names"></a> vSphere Operators Can Use Whitespace in Folder Names

vSphere's vCenter allows you to designate folder names with multiple words separated by spaces. That ability is reflected in Ops Manager. You can specify folder names in vCenter using spaces between words and Ops Manager will accept them as valid.

For an example of folder names with spaces, see [Using the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/nexus-switch.html).

### <a id="vsphere-properties"></a> Tile Developers Can Implement a Form Verifier to Confirm vSphere Properties

An operator configuring a product tile on a vSphere deployment must configure vSphere properties. Incorrect configuration can cause deployment failures, and can be difficult to troubleshoot effectively. An optional form verifier is available that notifies tile operators when they have configured vSphere properties incorectly.

For more information about this form verifier, see the [*install\_time\_verifiers*](http://www.example.com) section in *Property and Template References* in the tile developer documentation.

### <a id="blobstore-backups"></a> Added Strategies for Backing Up BOSH Blobstore to S3 and GCS

The BOSH Director tile > **Director Config** pane supports multiple strategies for backing up the BOSH Director blobstore to external S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets:

* **S3 with versioning**: Back up to prior version of blobstore bucket.
* **S3 without versioning**: Back up to S3 bucket dedicated to blobstore backup.
* **GCS**: Back up to GCS bucket dedicated to blobstore backup.

See the _Director Config Page_ section of the _Configuring BOSH Director_ topic for your IaaS, which you can navigate to from the [IaaS-Specific Deployment Guidelines](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/deploy-bosh-om.html#contents) section of the _Deploying BOSH and Ops Manager_ topic.

### <a id="pre-deploy-check-endpoint"></a> API Endpoint Returns Deployment Configuration Details

The `/api/v0/staged/products/:product_guid/pre_deploy_check` Ops Manager API endpoint returns configuration details about a deployment. This allows you to verify the details of your deployment before clicking **Apply Changes**, and to troubleshoot failed deploys.

For example, you can view the networks and availability zones assigned to products in your deployment. You can use this information to determine if any products are not assigned a network or availability zone, which causes the deploy to fail.

For more information, see [Running a pre-deploy check for the staged BOSH Director](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/opsman-api/#running-a-pre-deploy-check-for-the-staged-bosh-director) in the Ops Manager API documentation.

### <a id='monitor-port'></a> Operators Can Specify a Monitor Port When Defining an NSX Load Balancer

The Ops Manager API allows you to specify a monitor port when defining an NSX load balancer with the `monitor_port` parameter. This means the monitor port value does not default to the same value as the traffic port.

For more information, see [Configuring resources for a job (Experimental)](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#configuring-resources-for-a-job-experimental) in the Ops Manager API documentation.

### <a id='port-optional'></a> Operators Not Required to Specify a Port for NSX Load Balancers

The Ops Manager API no longer requires you to specify a port for NSX load balancers. When a port is not specified, the TCP router relies on a default port that is specified by other components in the system.

For more information, see [Configuring resources for a job (Experimental)](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/opsman-api/#configuring-resources-for-a-job-experimental) in the Ops Manager API documentation.

### <a id='automatic-ca'></a> Fresh Installations of Ops Manager Create New Default Certificate Authority in CredHub

When installing Ops Manager v2.6, Ops Manager creates a new default certificate authority (CA) in the BOSH Director CredHub. This CA can generate TLS certificates.

When upgrading to Ops Manager v2.6 from Ops Manager v2.5, any CA that already exists does not get overwritten.

For more information about certificates and certificate authorities, see [Certificates and TLS in PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/security/pcf-infrastructure/certificates-index.html).

### <a id='changelog'></a> Improved Change Log Page

The Ops Manager Change Log page has an improved UI, with deployment status and build times listed individually for each product, as well as for the deployment as a whole.

For more information, see the [Change Log Page](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/pcf-interface.html#changelog) section in the _Using the Ops Manager Interface_ topic.

### <a id='deploy-times'></a> Product Deployment Times from API and Change Log Page

Ops Manager publishes deployment times for individual products and whole deployments.

The Ops Manager API returns `started_at` and `finished_at` timestamps from its `/api/v0/installations` endpoint.

The Ops Manager UI **Change Log** page publishes these start and end timestamps, and durations calculated from them. For more information about viewing start and end timestamps on the **Change Log** page, see [Improved Change Log Page](#changelog).

### <a id='syslog-template'></a> Ops Manager Syslog Template Available for Service Broker Tiles

Tile developers can use the Ops Manager Syslog template form for their service broker tiles. The template makes tile users’ experience more consistent and secure. Tile developers can apply the Syslog template using the `opsmanager_syslog` key in their tile’s `metadata.yml` file.

For more information about the Syslog template, see [Syslog Form Template Available for Tile Authors](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#syslog).

### <a id='aws-regions'></a> Ops Manager Adds Support for All AWS Regions

The Ops Manager **AWS Config** pane includes an open text field for AWS region. This field allows you to input any AWS region when configuring BOSH Director on AWS.

For more information about adding an AWS region in Ops Manager, see [Step 2: AWS Config Page](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/om/aws/config-terraform.html#aws-config).

### <a id='5th-gen-instances'></a> AWS Deployments Use 5th Generation Instances

Ops Manager v2.6 uses the latest generation of instances for AWS deployments. When you upgrade to Ops Manager v2.6, your VM types convert to the corresponding 5th generation instance types, such as `t2` to `t3` and `c4` to `c5`.

If you are using a custom instance type catalog, your VM types that are used and available do not change.

These instance types are supported by Xenial stemcells and Trusty stemcell 3586 and later. Stemcells earlier than Trusty stemcell 3586 fail to boot Ops Manager.

For more information about AWS instance types, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) in the AWS documentation.

### <a id='compiled-bosh-release'></a> Specify Compiled Release Assets in BOSH Deployment Manifest  

An `exported_from` field in the `releases` section of the BOSH deployment manifest file allows you to specify the compiled release assets for the deployment. 

For example, the `exported_from` field in the following manifest file specifies that the deployment uses the packages from the release compiled against version `250.4` of `ubuntu-xenial`: 

```
releases:
- name: bpm
  url: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-compiled-release-tarballs/bpm-0.12.3-ubuntu-xenial-250.4.tgz
  version: 0.12.3
  exported_from:
  - os: ubuntu-xenial
    version: 250.4
```    

You can use the `exported_from` field to prevent BOSH from updating every VM with later versions of packages during a BOSH deployment. This saves time and reduces unexpected VM updates.   

For more information about using the `exported_from` field, see [Locking Compiled Releases](https://bosh.io/docs/locking-compiled-releases/) in the BOSH documentation.
