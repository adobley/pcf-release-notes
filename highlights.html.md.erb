 <%# This list comes from combining, selecting, and summarizing all the release notes, and punching them up a bit, informed by marketing -- see the Wiki https://docs-wiki.cfapps.io/wiki/team/release-manager.html#feature-highlights %>

This topic highlights important new features included in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v<%= vars.current_major_version %>.


## <a id='om'></a> PCF Ops Manager Highlights

Ops Manager v<%= vars.current_major_version %> includes the important major features. For additional information about these and other features included in Ops Manager v<%= vars.current_major_version %>, see [PCF Ops Manager v2.8 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-8/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html).

### <a id='om-optional-dependencies'></a> Add Optional Dependencies

Tile authors can declare optional dependencies

A tile does not need a hard dependency on another tile (eg: Healthwatch can be optionally dependent on PAS and PKS).

Operators do not have to care about the “right order” to deploy tiles.

### <a id='om-time-verifier'></a> Install Time Verifier

Operators are protected from service instance upgrade lag.

Tile authors can use a new Install Time Verifier to check for service instances that may be slow to update.

If it is not safe, the upgrade will quit, and the operator will see a warning message.

### <a id='om-system-metrics-agent'></a> System Metrics Agent

Ops Manager installs system metrics agent on all VMs by default
System metrics report the usage and status of VM memory, disk, CPU, network, load and swap space.

Other platform tools such as Pivotal Healthwatch and Pivotal App Metrics can consume these metrics.

### Tiles can be auto-imported on Ops Manager

### Ops Manager supports certificate authentication to vSphere NSX Manager

### Operators can use the API to revert pending changes

### Operators can configure multiple hardware security module (HSM) hosts in CredHub

### BOSH VMs can use signed URLs to communicate with Blobstore

## <a id='pas'></a> Pivotal Application Service (PAS) Highlights

PAS v<%= vars.current_major_version %> includes the following important major features. For additional information about these and other features included in PAS v<%= vars.current_major_version %>, see [Pivotal Application Service v2.8 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-8/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html).


### <a id='deploy-sidecar-buildpack'></a> Deploy a Sidecar with a Buidlpack

App developers can deploy a sidecar with a buildpack
Continues our support for user-provided sidecars, as in prior releases

Previously, the developer had to roll the sidecar process into the main app then deploy it with an app manifest.
Sidecars feature remains in beta


### <a id='manageable-upgrades'></a> More manageable upgrades of large PAS installations

Operators can more easily break up their PAS upgrades into multiple independently upgradeable chunks of Diego cells. This mechanism can also decouple the upgrades from the PAS control plane.

Enabled by “placement-tagless” with Isolation Segments.

PASW also supports this approach.

Similar to the “cell-block” upgrade mechanisms in PWS


### <a id='manageable-upgrades'></a> Push and manage apps built from container images hosted on AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

PAS v2.8 can run apps based on container images pulled from Amazon ECR.

You can migrate apps based on container images in ECR to PAS.

### <a id='credhub-instance-count'></a> Deploy At Least One CredHub Instance

Operators are required to deploy at least one instance of PAS CredHub.

PAS v2.8 does not deploy if the CredHub instance count is set to zero.

This update improves platform security by deploying PAS with one instance of CredHub by default. It also helps to avoid unexpected behaviors that occur when there are zero CredHub instances. 


### <a id='cpu-usage-metrics'></a> PAS Emits CPU Usage Metrics With CPU Entitlement

The PAS CPU usage metrics take into account CPU entitlement. This allows you to make more informed scaling decisions for your apps.

The CPU usage metric in PAS v2.8 is relative to the app CPU entitlement. A value of `100%` for CPU usage indiciates that the app is using all the CPU to which it is entitled. 

Previously, CPU usage metrics did not include data about how much CPU the app is entitled to use as compared to the CPU that it is currently using.


### <a id='apps-manager-scs-config'></a> Apps Manager SCS Config Server Integrations

You can see the configuration of your Spring Cloud Config Server instances on the Apps Manager service instance detail page.

You can view the online status of the SCS instance and perform a mirror sync from the details page.

This feature provides closer integrations with Spring Cloud, which means that you can work and troubleshoot more quickly.


### <a id='apps-manager-scs-config'></a> View Quota Information on Apps Manager

Quota information for the org is displayed in the org header, helping devs and admins understand resource usage


## <a id='observability'></a> Pivotal Platform Observability Highlights


### <a id='app-metrics-2-0'></a> App Metrics 2.0 

App Metrics v2.0 includes the following features:

* Extended, redundant metrics and logs datasets
* Micrometer metric support
* Multi-process and rolling deployment support
* Declarative, codified observability and monitoring
* Persistent dashboards
* Improved product speed and stability
* Reduced tile footprint

### <a id='custom-observability'></a> Custom App Observability

With Indicator Protocol and Pivotal App Metrics v2.0, app developers can push their observability and monitoring definitions with their code.

The following describes the benefits of using custom observability metrics:

* Declare the metrics that matter most to monitor app health 
* Define thresholds per metric and alert routing per app
* Define once, apply to multiple apps
* Monitor Spring Micrometer and tagged application metrics
* Can be automated in CI pipelines 
* Custom dashboards persist across all users 

### <a id='metric-egress'></a> Metric and Log Egress with System Metrics Agent

Operators can view VM metrics, including compute, network, and storage, for all runtime and service tile VMs with the System Metrics Agent. Previously, these metrics were available for PAS VMs only.

This is an improvement on the `bosh-system-metrics-forwarder`.

App, Org and Space GUID/Name are available as annotations on all PAS metrics and logs.

Operators can send logs for all apps to a single syslog destination with an aggregate syslog drain. So, you do not need to configure an individual syslog drain for each app.
