This topic describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to <%= vars.platform_name %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>. For more information about important preparation steps you must follow before beginning an upgrade, see [Upgrading <%= vars.platform_name %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

### <a id='v1-firehose-disabled'></a> V1 Firehose Is Disabled by Default

The Loggregator V1 Firehose is disabled by default. For more information, see [V1 Firehose Is Disabled By Defualt](runtime-rn.html#v1-firehose-disabled) in _<%= vars.app_runtime_full %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> Release Notes_.

The V1 Firehose uses Traffic Controllers to collect and stream logs and metrics. Any custom automation, tooling, or integrations that are dependent on Traffic Controller VMs will break on upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

To address this breaking change, do one of the following:

* **Use the V2 Firehose (Recommended)**: To use the V2 Firehose, remove any dependencies to the V1 Firehose before you upgrade. To remove dependencies:
  * Upgrade any service or partner tiles that are dependent on the V1 Firehose. 
  * Update any automation, tooling, or integrations that are dependent on the V1 Firehose.  
* **Enable the V1 Firehose**: To continue using automation, tooling, or integrations that are dependent on the V1 Firehose, you can enable the V1 Firehose after you stage and before you deploy <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> for the first time.
