This topic describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.8. For more information about important preparation steps you must follow before beginning an upgrade, see [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-8/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).


## <a id='opsman'></a> PCF Ops Manager

See the following PCF Ops Manager breaking changes:

### <a id='credhub-generated-field'></a> Reset Manually Set Certificates in CredHub Before Upgrade

Before you upgrade to Ops Manager v2.8, you must reset all manually set certificates in CredHub. This prevents the rotation of manually set certificates during a bulk certificate rotation in Ops Manager v2.8. 

After upgrade to Ops Manager v2.7, existing CredHub certificates are assigned a `null` value for the `generated` field. The `generated` field tracks whether a certificate has been manually set or generated. However, existing certificates are not migrated to use this field. 

When instructed to rotate certificates, Ops Manager v2.8 does a bulk rotation of all certificates where `generated` is either `true` or `null`. For more information about this feature, see [Ops Manager API Rotates CredHub Certificates and Certificate Authorities](./opsmanager-rn.html#om-api-rotate-credhub-certs) in _Ops Manager v2.8 Release Notes_.

To prevent the bulk rotation of a manually set certificate in CredHub, you must manually reset the certificate. This updates the `generated` field to `false`, rather than `null`. 

To reset a certificate in CredHub, see [Reviewing and Resetting Manually Set Certificates in CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-8/security/pcf-infrastructure/manual-credhub-certificate.html).

## <a id='ist'></a> PCF Isolation Segment

See the following PCF Isolation Segment breaking changes:

### <a id='property-renamed'></a> Segment Name Property Is Renamed

The property `.isolated_diego_cell.placement_tag` is renamed `.properties.compute_isolation`. This property contains the following inputs:

* `.properties.compute_isolation.disabled` to disable compute isolation

* `.properties.compute_isolation.enabled` to enable compute isolation

* `.properties.compute_isolation.enabled.isolation_segment_name` to add a placement tag for your Diego Cells when compute isolation is enabled

You must update any platform automation scripts that include `.isolated_diego_cell.placement_tag` to use the new `.properties.compute_isolation` inputs.

### <a id='compute-isolation-router-sharding'></a> Compute Isolation and Router Sharding Must Be Configured Simultaneously

Compute isolation is enabled by default. However, isolation segments do not require compute isolation.

In the **Compute and Network Isolation** pane, you can disable compute isolation by selecting **Disable** under **Compute isolation**. If you disable compute isolation, you must set **Router sharding mode** to **No Isolation Segment**.

For more information, see the [Compute and Networking Isolation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-8/customizing/installing-pcf-is.html#compute-networking-isolation) section in the _Installing <%= vars.product_name %> Isolation Segment_ topic.
